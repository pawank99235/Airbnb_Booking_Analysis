# Airbnb_Booking_Analysis
For this project, we would be analysing Airbnb NYC data available for a number of years. The dataset comprises of data regarding price and availability of all kinds of rooms across different locations across the region.

The main objective behind the project is to analyse and inspect to find out important factors that affect the business and also to provide valuable insights to the organisation which would then lead to enhancement of quality services being offered and to make decisions to upgrade their offerings.
